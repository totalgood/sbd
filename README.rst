Sentence boundary detection by Kyle Gorman (under the name "DetectorMorse" in 2015) repackaged and maintained by Hobson Lane in 2016.

## Description

A single-layer perceptron (fully-connected linear neural network) for detecting sentence boundaries and generating a sequence of sentences from a text file or string. For more information on the architecture see Kyle Gorman's [talks and documentation](https://github.com/cslu-nlp/DetectorMorse).

## PyScaffold Rocks!

This project was set up using PyScaffold. See [pyscaffold.readthedocs.org](http://pyscaffold.readthedocs.org/) to find out how you too can build your stuff with good scaffolding. I've added a git pre-commit hook that automates only last little bit, the generation of *.rst files from *.md.
